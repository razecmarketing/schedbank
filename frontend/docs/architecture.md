# Frontend Architecture Documentation

## Clean Architecture Implementation

This frontend follows Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture principles with strict layer separation.

### Layer Structure

```
src/
├── domain/           # Business Rules (Enterprise Business Rules)
│   ├── entities/     # Core business objects
│   ├── valueobjects/ # Immutable domain concepts
│   ├── exceptions/   # Domain-specific errors
│   └── ports/        # Abstractions for external dependencies
├── application/      # Application Business Rules
│   ├── usecases/     # Use case implementations
│   └── stores/       # Application state management
├── infrastructure/   # Frameworks & Drivers
│   ├── http/         # HTTP client adapters
│   ├── repositories/ # Data access implementations
│   └── router/       # Routing configuration
└── presentation/     # Interface Adapters
    └── components/   # Vue.js UI components
```

### Dependency Rule

Dependencies point inward only:
- Presentation → Application → Domain
- Infrastructure → Application → Domain
- No layer depends on outer layers

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Value Objects Pattern
- `Money`: Encapsulates monetary values with validation
- `AccountNumber`: Ensures 10-digit account format
- Immutable objects with business validation

#### 2. Repository Pattern
- `TransferRepository` (interface) in domain
- `ApiTransferRepository` (implementation) in infrastructure
- Dependency Inversion Principle applied

#### 3. Dependency Injection
- Manual DI container in `main.js`
- Services injected via Vue's provide/inject
- Clean separation of concerns

#### 4. Exception Handling
- Domain-specific exceptions
- Clear error boundaries between layers
- Meaningful error messages for users

#### 5. State Management
- Pinia store in application layer
- Business logic in use cases, not in store
- Store acts as state coordinator only

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- All domain logic tested in isolation
- Value objects tested for invariants
- Use cases tested with mocked dependencies

#### Integration Tests
- Component testing with real dependencies
- API integration testing
- End-to-end user workflows

### Performance Considerations

- Reactive state management with Vue 3 Composition API
- Lazy loading of routes and components
- Optimistic UI updates
- Error boundaries for resilience

### Security Measures

- Input validation at domain layer
- XSS protection via Vue templates
- CORS configuration for API communication
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## Technology Stack

- **Vue.js 3**: Reactive UI framework
- **Composition API**: Modern Vue development
- **Pinia**: Type-safe state management
- **Vue Router**: SPA routing
- **Axios**: HTTP client
- **Vite**: Fast build tool
- **Vitest**: Testing framework

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility
- Each class has one reason to change
- Components focus on presentation only
- Services handle specific business logic

### Open/Closed
- New fee policies can be added without changing existing code
- Component extension via composition
- Plugin architecture for dependencies

### Liskov Substitution
- Repository implementations are interchangeable
- Value objects maintain contracts
- Polymorphic behavior where appropriate

### Interface Segregation
- Small, focused interfaces
- Components receive only needed dependencies
- Minimal coupling between layers

### Dependency Inversion
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Abstractions don't depend on details
- Manual dependency injection container
